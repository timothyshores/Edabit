# Same Number of Unique Elements

Write a function that returns `true` if two arrays have the same number of unique elements, and `false` otherwise.

To illustrate:

```
arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4]
arr2 = [2, 5, 7]
```

In `arr1`, the number `4` appears three times, which means it contains three unique elements: `[1, 3, 4]`. Since `arr1` and `arr2` both contain the same number of unique elements, this example would return `true`.

**Examples**
```
same([1, 3, 4, 4, 4], [2, 5, 7]) ➞ true

same([9, 8, 7, 6], [4, 4, 3, 1]) ➞ false

same([2], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ➞ true
```
