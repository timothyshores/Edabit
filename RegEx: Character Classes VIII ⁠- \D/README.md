# RegEx: Character Classes VIII ‚Å†- \D

You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. They are recognized as special when you place the `\` before the character.

There is a hidden message in this string:
```
const str = "242Edabit23 45can344 3be3 254324addictive!"
```
Write the regular expression that reveals the hidden message. You have to remove all of the numbers to reveal the message. Use the character class `\D` in your expression.
